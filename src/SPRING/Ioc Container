Inversion of Control - When we give control of object creation to spring and it dynamically creates object
of all dependencies at runtime.

The container will           -create the objects,
                             -wire them together, (hold them in memory)
                             -configure them, (inject object as required)
                             -manage their complete life cycle from creation till destruction.


The Spring IoC container makes use of Java POJO classes and configuration metadata to produce a fully
configured and executable system or application.

                        Java POJO classes

                              |
          Meta data ---> Spring Container
                              |
                              |    Final result
                              |
                        Ready to use App.
